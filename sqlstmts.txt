//drop
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS SCHEMA.TABLENAME;
$sql = 'DROP TABLE IF EXISTS '.$tablename.';';
The DROP TABLE statement removes a table added with the CREATE TABLE statement. 
The name specified is the table name. 
The dropped table is completely removed from the database schema and the disk file. 
The table can not be recovered. All indices and triggers associated with the table are also deleted.
The optional IF EXISTS clause suppresses the error that would normally result if the table does not exist.
